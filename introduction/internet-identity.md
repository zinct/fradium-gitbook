# Internet Identity

[**Internet Identity**](https://identity.ic0.app/) is a secure, privacy-preserving, and user-friendly authentication system designed for the Internet Computer ecosystem. It enables users to access decentralized applications (dapps) safely and anonymously. Below are the key features of Internet Identity:

* **Passwordless Login**: Rather than relying on traditional usernames and passwords, Internet Identity leverages _passkeys_ cryptographic pairs of public and private keys. Users can authenticate using biometrics like fingerprint (TouchID) or facial recognition (FaceID), or through hardware security devices such as YubiKeys and Ledger wallets.
* **Privacy by Design**: A unique pseudonym is generated for each dapp a user interacts with, preventing cross-app tracking and significantly boosting privacy.
* **Fully Decentralized and Secure**: Internet Identity runs entirely on the Internet Computer blockchain. This decentralized infrastructure allows users to inspect and verify the code, enhancing both transparency and security.
* **Seamless Cross-Device Access**: Users can create an _identity anchor_ and link multiple devices, allowing easy access to dapps from various platforms without handling complex cryptographic details.
* **No Personal Data Collection**: Unlike conventional authentication systems, Internet Identity does not request or store any personal identifying information from users.
* **WebAuthn Support**: Built on the WebAuthn standard, Internet Identity is compatible with most modern browsers and operating systems, ensuring broad and reliable support.
